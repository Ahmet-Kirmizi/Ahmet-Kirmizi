As an 18-year-old junior software developer with a passion for full-stack development, I gained valuable experience during a two-month internship at FurtherSoft Software in Nicosia, Cyprus, where I worked as a full-stack developer intern. My current focus is on honing my skills in the Vue, Nuxt, Laravel and Node.js ecosystem, and I am excited to bring my enthusiasm and expertise to new challenges and opportunities.
