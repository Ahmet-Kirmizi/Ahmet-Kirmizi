As an 18-year-old junior software developer with a passion for full-stack development, I am currently working at FurtherSoft as a full-stack developer. During my internship at FurtherSoft Software in Nicosia, Cyprus, I gained valuable experience and insight into the industry, which has helped me develop my skills further. Since then, I have been focusing on honing my skills in the Vue, Nuxt, Laravel, and Node.js ecosystem and am excited to apply my expertise to new challenges and opportunities. Working with a team of experienced professionals at FurtherSoft has been an invaluable experience, and I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to their mission of providing innovative software solutions.
